## Get to Know AppsCode

AppsCode is a global leader in Enterprise-grade Kubernetes-native Data Platforms. AppsCode has released KubeDB Enterprise Edition, a production-grade cloud-native database management solution for Kubernetes. AppsCode is building a universal cloud native data platform for the age of Kubernetes. AppsCode was established in 2016 by Tamal Saha, a former Google engineer. AppsCode develops a number of popular products for Kubernetes, namely KubeDB, Stash, KubeVault, Kubeform, Voyager. 

## The Problem

Kubernetes has emerged as the de-facto way to deploy modern containerized apps on cloud or on-premises. Despite all that growth on the application layer, the data layer hasn’t gotten as much traction with containerization. That’s not surprising, since handling things like state (the database), availability to other layers of the application, and redundancy for a database makes it challenging to run a database in a distributed environment like Kubernetes. However, many developers want to treat data infrastructure the same as application stacks. This is where [KubeDB by AppsCode](kubedb.com) comes as a solution.

## The Solution

KubeDB provides you with many familiar database engines to choose from, including PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis and Memcached. And the list is growing. KubeDB’s native integration with Kubernetes makes a unique solution compared to competitive solutions from cloud providers and database vendors. It is also very easy to use and AppsCode support is very responsive. 

## Community

KubeDB is in production and powering critical infrastructure for many enterprises in Telecom, Healthcare, Gaming, EPR, and Financial industries. Our open-core go-to-market approach has resulted in a community of 2000+ developers with 10M+  Docker downloads and 3K+ unique deployments every month.
